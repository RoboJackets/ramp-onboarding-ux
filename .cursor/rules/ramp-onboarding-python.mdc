This repository is a Python Flask application. It uses Poetry for dependency management.

Any Python commands must be prefixed with "poetry run" so that they execute within the virtual environment created by Poetry.

All code should pass linters:

poetry run black ramp_onboarding_ux.py

poetry run flake8 ramp_onboarding_ux.py

poetry run pylint ramp_onboarding_ux.py

poetry run mypy --strict --scripts-are-modules ramp_onboarding_ux.py
